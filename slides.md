# What is the leadership development group doing that is helping?
* open forum to share ideas about leadership in development
* addresses relevant topics
* geared towards Clearwater
* Getting developers to think about non-technical topics

Having the discussion is an important first step. The content--and maybe more importantly--the preparation are key. The preparation needs to include a moment taken to ask, "does this meet what the audience needs or wants?" If that can't be answered affirmatively, then the presentation/workshop needs to be adjusted or reworked.


# If you don't come what prevents you from coming?
The time of the meetings is pretty rough when you work on a team with a production-critical tool. Would help to do it at a different time later in the morning.

Busy schedule and not being on the email list previously. I'd like to be present for more going forward.

For me, LDG is fairly high on my priority list. It feels like we have picked up a /lot/ of more formal meetings/interest groups/development opportunities recently. I simply have to balance those opportunities against the work I'm responsible for in the short term.

Scheduling conflicts

too many other priorities

Work. I either in the middle of something urgent or have a meeting scheduled that is about a project we are working on.

Not enough leaders at the company involved in the discussions

Presentations are generally just one person's opinion

# What could be improved about the leadership development group?

From the one that I attended (mentoring), it was reasonably good. There could have been improvements/more of the ice breaker questions to start the discussion. The video could have been longer or if possible contained a deeper dive into the practical concerns in getting mentorship set up.

We should come together to determine what our goals are. Do we want to focus on being a forum to share ideas? Do we want to actively look for ways and people to collaborate with to improve leadership and mentorship at Clearwater? Do we want to offer a place for new leaders to feel supported? Once we determine those goals, it'll be easier to find a path forward

Outside speakers? Some kind of practical application that can be done immediately--it's one of the only ways to make ideas stick and prove out if something works.

More speakers would help. I wish we could have more representation from division leads to get their perspective.

More involvement from leaders within development 

I think it'd be interesting to add a component to meetings where people could anonymously submit questions or situations they'd like to discuss at the end of the meeting. For me, I have some interesting situations that have come up, but I'm hesitant to share them in person because Clearwater is so small that it's easy to guess who the people are in whatever anecdote is related to the situation. 

The number of people attending has to increase to a critical mass, so people feel they're missing out if they don't come
